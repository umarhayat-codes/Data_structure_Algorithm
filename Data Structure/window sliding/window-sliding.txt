The Sliding Window technique is a powerful approach for solving array and string problems efficiently, especially when 
you need to find a subset of elements that satisfy a particular condition. Sliding window is commonly used for problems 
that involve finding subarrays (contiguous subsets of an array) or substrings with a certain property.

When we use it :
	for contiguous subarray and substring

Approach:
	1. initial window 
	2. we slide window using loop
		a. add rightmost mean right new item
		b. remove leftmost mean first item of window
