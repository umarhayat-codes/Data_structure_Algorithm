Stack:
A stack is a linear data structure where data is stored in a sequential manner, similar to an array. However, unlike an array, stack operations are restricted
 to one end (called the top of the stack).


Principal : LIFO mean last in first out

Why We Use a Stack:
When the last item added needs to be accessed or removed first.
It helps manage problems where temporary data needs to be stored and then accessed in reverse order.
Basic Operation: we use all array operation

Applications of Stack:

Reversing Words: Store characters of a word in a stack, and then pop them to reverse the word.
Undo/Redo Operations: Most text editors use stacks to store actions for undo and redo functionality.
Browser History:
When you navigate to a new page, the current page is pushed onto the stack.
When you click the "Back" button, the top page is popped from the stack to return to the previous page.


Aspect	Array	Stack
Access	Random access using an index.	Access is restricted to the top.
Order	No strict order of insertion/removal.	Follows LIFO (Last In, First Out).
Operations	Insert, delete, traverse, search.	Push, pop, peek, isEmpty.
Flexibility	General-purpose structure.	Specialized structure for LIFO.
Size	Usually fixed or dynamic.	Dynamic or based on an array size.
Use Case	General data storage and manipulation.	Temporary data management (LIFO).
